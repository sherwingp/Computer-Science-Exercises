# Sherwin's Computer Science Portfolio

This is a collection of my maths and programming exercises and projects. 
My portfolio can be found at: https://sherwingp.github.io/Computer-Science-Portfolio/.

They are a combination of challenges and adapted examples from 'Doing Math with Python' (Amit Saha), Project Euler challenges, programming assignments from Imperial's Maths for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus, and other projects.
