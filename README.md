# maths-and-programming

This is a collection of my maths and programming exercises and projects.

They are a combination of challenges and adapted examples from 'Doing Math with Python' (Amit Saha), Project Euler challenges, programming assignments from Imperial's Maths for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus, and other projects.
